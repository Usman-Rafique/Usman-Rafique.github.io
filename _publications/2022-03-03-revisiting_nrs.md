## Abstract
This work addresses the task of overhead image segmentation when auxiliary ground-level images are available. Recent work has shown that performing joint inference over these two modalities, often called near/remote sensing, can yield significant accuracy improvements. Extending this line of work, we introduce the concept of geospatial attention, a geometry-aware attention mechanism that explicitly considers the geospatial relationship between the pixels in a ground-level image and a geographic location. We propose an approach for computing geospatial attention that incorporates geometric features and the appearance of the overhead and ground-level imagery. We introduce a novel architecture for near/remote sensing that is based on geospatial attention and demonstrate its use for five segmentation tasks. The results demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms the previous state-of-the-art methods.

## Approach
![Approach](/images/nrs_approach.png)
We propose a high-level neural network architecture for the task of near/remote sensing. Our architecture, visualized in Figure 3, has three primary components. First, we extract features from each image modality. Next, we use geospatial attention to generate a spatially consistent, dense grid of geo-informative features from the set of nearby ground-level images. Finally, we fuse the dense ground-level feature map with the overhead image feature map and use that as input to a decoder that generates the segmentation output. All components are differentiable, enabling end-to-end optimization of the low-level feature extraction networks and the attention model for the given segmentation task
