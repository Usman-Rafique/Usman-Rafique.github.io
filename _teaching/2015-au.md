I was a full-time lecturer at the Air University from 2010 to 2015. Here is a [link](https://sites.google.com/site/mtsengg/) to my old website that I maintained during teaching.

Courses
======
* Embedded Systems
* Mechatronic System Design
* Applied Mechatronics

Senior Design Projects
======
I supervsied several senior design projects. If you are curious about old robotics project, you can find a list of projects [here](https://sites.google.com/site/mtsengg/projects).

This was a project on [multiple mobile robots](https://sites.google.com/site/mtsengg/projects/multiple-mobile-robots)
