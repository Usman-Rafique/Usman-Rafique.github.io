I was part of a team of 4 instructors that conducted the capstone design courses at the [Electrical and Computer Engineering](https://www.engr.uky.edu/research-faculty/departments/electrical-computer-engineering). I worked as an instructor for 2 years, from 2016 to 2018. While I was officially a teaching assistant for the course, I was performed the same duties as the three professors on the team.

ECE Capstone Design 1 & 2
======
My responsibilities included
* Discussing project progress with teams
* Grading lab notebooks and giving feedback
* Attending and grading proposal, progress, and final presentation
* Grading individual research reports
* Grading team reports

This experience was similar to my [previous teaching experience](http://urafique.com/teaching/au-1). Many ECE students chose projects related to robotics and computer vision and I was glad to be involved in this.
