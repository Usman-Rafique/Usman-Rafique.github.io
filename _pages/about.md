I am PhD candidate at the University of Kentucky working on computer vision and machine learning. Broadly, my research is about combining information from multiple images for scene understanding and image synthesis.

I am a member of the [Multimodal Vision Research Lab](http://mvrl.cs.uky.edu/) working with [Dr. Nathan Jacobs](https://jacobsn.github.io/). My co-advisor is [Dr. Samson Cheung](https://sites.google.com/view/dr-cheung).
