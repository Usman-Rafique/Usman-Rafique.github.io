I am a researcher working on computer vision and machine learning. Broadly, my research is about combining information from multiple images for scene understanding and image synthesis. I did PhD from University of Kentucky. During PhD, I was a member of the [Multimodal Vision Research Lab](http://mvrl.cs.uky.edu/) working with [Dr. Nathan Jacobs](https://jacobsn.github.io/). My co-advisor was [Dr. Samson Cheung](https://sites.google.com/view/dr-cheung).

I am currently working at Kitware Inc. as a senior research and development engineer. This is the link to [my Kitware page](https://www.kitware.com/usman-rafique/). 

My old website from my teaching days is [available here](https://sites.google.com/site/mtsengg/) (no longer maintained).
