I am a researcher working on computer vision and machine learning. My research areas include image synthesis, image understanding, and scene parsing and segmentation. I have been working with natural, outdoor scenes and remote sensing images (both aerial and satellite).

Recently, I have been working on large language models (LLMs) such as GPT. I have implemented GPT-Nano, a light-weight alternative of GPT-2 and GPT-3. I am currently working on efficient fine-tuning a 20 billion GPT model on a single GPU (blog post coming soon).


During PhD from the University of Kentucky, I was a member of the [Multimodal Vision Research Lab](http://mvrl.cs.uky.edu/) working with [Dr. Nathan Jacobs](https://jacobsn.github.io/). My co-advisor was [Dr. Samson Cheung](https://sites.google.com/view/dr-cheung). My PhD research was about combining information from multiple images for scene understanding and image synthesis.

After finishing PhD, I worked at [Kitware Inc.](https://www.kitware.com/) as a senior research and development engineer for 1 year and 9 months. 

My old website from my teaching days is [available here](https://sites.google.com/site/mtsengg/).

Update July 2023
~~I am now looking for new opportunities :) Feel free to reach out, my contact details are on the left panel.~~

**Update Aug 2023**
I have finished my job search; excited to join RnD Lab of [Bastian Solutions](https://www.bastiansolutions.com/), a Toyota Advanced Logistics Company, as a Senior Machine Learning Engineer. I will be doing research on computer vision models for robotics and automation.
